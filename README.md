# Mad Libz Story Generator
This program is written in both in python and C++ for practice  

python is relatively easy to handle and understand so i made a dynaic version in python that randomly picks a story from a stories list and asks for the words that are required in that story dynamically

whereas C++ is a bit complex and requires more libraries to handle this type of fun project so i just made a static version that has only 3 stries coded in the program and user will select which story to chose currently only 3 stories are available small, medium and large story and they are static because they have limited number of words to change and the words to change are coded manually they are not dynamically picked by the program
